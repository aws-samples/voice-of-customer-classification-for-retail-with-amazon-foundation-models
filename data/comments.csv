"I recently tested using a Huawei charger to charge my new smartphone, and found that it did not work. After getting my new device, I tried using a Huawei USB-A charger, but it was unable to charge my phone. However, chargers from other brands like Xiaomi and Oppo worked fine.

I contacted the customer support of both Apple and Huawei about this issue. Both companies advised using the original charging equipment provided with the device, as using incompatible chargers can potentially damage the battery or pose safety risks.

When asked if the charging issue was related to the PD (Power Delivery) protocol, Apple said they haven't provided any official statements on that, and reiterated the recommendation to use the original charger. Huawei also stated that the charging compatibility depends on the specifications of the phone.","Third-party charger, data cable incompatibility"

"1. My new smartphone has a yellowish screen, much more than my previous model. However, it seems similar to the display in the store, so I guess this is a common issue with the current model (cold screens might be rare).
2. When I set the brightness to the maximum, it's significantly higher than my friend's same model. This seems a bit strange.
3. The screen appears yellowish when viewed straight on, but turns cooler when viewed from an angle. In fact, I actually prefer the cooler color tone from the side view (though it's a bit uncomfortable). I've asked the store and the manufacturer, and they said this is a characteristic of OLED screens. But I don't see many people discussing this issue online, so I wonder if I'm just overly sensitive to color tones (my friends also only noticed it after I pointed it out).

"After upgrading to the latest version of the operating system, many users have reported issues with their mobile devices not detecting the SIM card. According to some online reports, the phone may display a ""No SIM card"" message, and even switching to airplane mode may not resolve the problem. Fortunately, a simple restart of the device seems to fix the issue for most users.

However, this problem is not limited to the latest OS update - some owners of the newest smartphone model have also encountered the ""No SIM card"" problem, with the issue persisting even after a restart. Industry experts suggest that this could be related to compatibility issues between the phone's baseband and the carrier's network in certain regions, which may prevent the device from properly recognizing the local network.

In the past, a similar problem was also reported after a previous OS update, where some users experienced ""no service"" errors due to coverage signal issues. In those cases, a restart or removing and re-inserting the SIM card helped resolve the problem for some, while others had to visit a carrier store to get a new SIM card.
