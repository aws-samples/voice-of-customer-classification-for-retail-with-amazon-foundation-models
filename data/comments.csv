"A concerning issue has shaken the tech industry. After the launch of the new smartphone models, users have reported overheating problems. This not only affects the user experience, but could also pose a challenge to the company's sales performance.

On Reddit, a user posted that their new smartphone's back reached 108째F (42째C) after just 5 minutes of use. Further testing showed the temperature even reaching 116.5째F (47째C), which is clearly outside the normal heating range for a mobile device.

Tech media has also reported on this overheating problem. A user survey with 6,696 participants found that 18.79% experienced overheating during charging, 11.22% in intensive usage like gaming, and 26.91% during regular daily use.

Investigations suggest this may not be related to the 3nm manufacturing process, but rather due to compromises in the thermal design, such as smaller heat dissipation areas and the use of titanium alloy. 

The company has not yet publicly addressed this issue, but is expected to provide a software update as a fix. However, unless processor performance is reduced, the impact may be limited, as the root cause of the thermal challenges remains unresolved.

If this problem is not properly addressed, it could negatively impact the sales of these new smartphone models. Persistent overheating issues can severely undermine the user experience and satisfaction.

Overall, this overheating problem poses a significant challenge for the company. They need to not only solve the technical issues, but also provide a timely and effective response to the market feedback. Hopefully a solution can be found to deliver a more seamless user experience.",Overheating

"The new titanium alloy frame on the latest flagship smartphones seems to have a tendency to pick up fingerprints and discoloration from skin oils. According to the manufacturer, this is a normal and temporary effect, and can be easily wiped away with a soft, slightly damp, lint-free cloth to restore the original appearance.

While the use of titanium alloy instead of stainless steel makes the phones lighter and more corrosion-resistant, it also contributes to this fingerprint issue. However, this is likely not a major concern for most users, as the overall build quality and in-hand feel of these premium devices are still excellent.

For regular cleaning, it's recommended to avoid using any cleaning products and compressed air, and instead gently wipe the phone's surfaces with a soft, damp cloth. Care should also be taken to prevent any moisture from entering the device's openings. With proper maintenance, these flagship smartphones should continue to look and perform well over time.",Easily retains fingerprints

"1. My new smartphone has a yellowish screen, much more than my previous model. However, it seems similar to the display in the store, so I guess this is a common issue with the current model (cold screens might be rare).
2. When I set the brightness to the maximum, it's significantly higher than my friend's same model. This seems a bit strange.
3. The screen appears yellowish when viewed straight on, but turns cooler when viewed from an angle. In fact, I actually prefer the cooler color tone from the side view (though it's a bit uncomfortable). I've asked the store and the manufacturer, and they said this is a characteristic of OLED screens. But I don't see many people discussing this issue online, so I wonder if I'm just overly sensitive to color tones (my friends also only noticed it after I pointed it out).

"After upgrading to the latest version of the operating system, many users have reported issues with their mobile devices not detecting the SIM card. According to some online reports, the phone may display a ""No SIM card"" message, and even switching to airplane mode may not resolve the problem. Fortunately, a simple restart of the device seems to fix the issue for most users.

However, this problem is not limited to the latest OS update - some owners of the newest smartphone model have also encountered the ""No SIM card"" problem, with the issue persisting even after a restart. Industry experts suggest that this could be related to compatibility issues between the phone's baseband and the carrier's network in certain regions, which may prevent the device from properly recognizing the local network.

In the past, a similar problem was also reported after a previous OS update, where some users experienced ""no service"" errors due to coverage signal issues. In those cases, a restart or removing and re-inserting the SIM card helped resolve the problem for some, while others had to visit a carrier store to get a new SIM card.

Overall, it appears that software updates can sometimes introduce compatibility problems between mobile devices and carrier networks, leading to SIM card detection issues. Hopefully the manufacturer can address this problem through future software patches.",SIM card not detected
