For those affected, the only solution seems to be upgrading to the latest beta version, which reportedly fixes the problem. To do this, you'll need to install a beta profile on your device.

"Many users have reported that after updating to the latest version of the operating system, there is a persistent notification that the device's storage space is almost full. This notification cannot be dismissed, even after freeing up a significant amount of storage. Some users have reported seeing this message despite having 40GB or more of free space.
This issue seems to be widespread, with many users discussing it on social media platforms, but the company has yet to provide a response. Restarting the device does not appear to resolve the problem. While this notification may not directly impact daily usage, it can be misleading and force users to unnecessarily clear storage space or delete files.
Additionally, some users have encountered other issues, such as the inability to access the app store or loss of cellular service, though these seem to be less prevalent. There have also been complaints about changes to the ""focus mode"" feature, which some users feel has lost an important functionality.
It's understandable that even the most advanced software can have bugs upon release, but users are primarily seeking a stable, smooth, and battery-efficient experience, rather than a constant stream of new features accompanied by issues. Companies should focus their efforts on improving system stability and reliability to provide a more comfortable user experience.",High storage usage

"Over time, the latest smartphone models have gradually become more powerful. I believe many users have already received their new devices and started using them.

Although the market has faced some challenges this year, the new models still offer attractive specifications that appeal to many consumers. 

The device's operating system and processor are still widely recognized by users, so the overall sales performance should be decent.

However, for older models, the user experience may be slightly weaker, especially after updating to the latest OS version, as many users have reported various issues.

One common problem is a significant reduction in battery life after the update, which greatly impacts the user experience. 

To address this issue, the company has quickly released a new software update, which is said to include important bug fixes and security updates. This update is recommended for all users.

Yet, some users report that the latest update still hasn't resolved the issue of photos crashing the app during zoom. Further updates may be needed to fully fix this problem.

Interestingly, this latest update seems to be primarily targeted at the older device models, as a separate update has been released specifically for the newest smartphone series.

This newer update is said to fix issues with data transfer during the setup process, which apparently wasn't a problem for the older models.

Hopefully, future updates will be more unified across all device models, as disparities can be difficult for users to accept.",Data loss after update

"My partner gifted me the new phone in a beautiful blue color for our first wedding anniversary. I had originally ordered the white model, but it would have taken too long to arrive. My partner wanted the blue color, and my friend had also purchased the blue one, so I decided to switch my order. To my surprise, my partner secretly arranged for a colleague to purchase the blue phone from a duty-free store in Sanya, which was even a bit cheaper than the official website. 

Regarding the issues I've experienced, I've encountered a few minor problems that I've read about online. The camera sometimes experiences a brief flash when switching focus on close-up shots. During video calls, there's a thin white line on the side of the small window showing the other person. The barcode scanning feature also has a brief lag. And in low-light conditions, I've noticed some green spots around bright light sources, which seems to be a normal side effect.

Overall, the battery life has been quite good, especially compared to my previous device. My friend also reported a few small issues with her new phone, but based on the information available, they seem to be minor problems that can likely be resolved through software updates.

"According to the analysis by analyst Guo Minghao, the overheating issue with the current smartphone model is not related to the 3nm process used by the chip manufacturer. Instead, it is likely due to design compromises made to reduce the weight of the device, such as a smaller heat dissipation area and the use of titanium alloy which may impact the cooling performance. Guo expects the company to address this problem through software updates, but the improvements may be limited unless they are willing to reduce the processor performance. If the company fails to properly resolve this issue, it could negatively impact the sales volume of this product line. Additionally, the use of titanium alloy for the first time in the new smartphone models has resulted in a series of problems, including easily scratched surfaces, discoloration of the metal frame, and poor drop resistance - all of which need to be addressed in future product iterations.",Overheating

"Recently, some of the first owners of the new smartphone models have complained online that the phones overheat when in use or charging. The new smartphone series has been jokingly referred to as ""fiery fruit"" as a result.

According to reports, the company has acknowledged that there are some issues that may be causing the phones to run at high temperatures, including bugs in the latest operating system. The company stated that it will fix these problems in an upcoming software update. They also noted that the overheating issue does not pose a safety risk and will not impact the long-term performance of the devices.

Additionally, the company said the overheating has also been observed when running certain third-party apps, and they are working with the app developers to address these problems.

"I've been using the new smartphone model for a while now, and while it has some great features, I've also encountered a few issues. Some of these problems are from my own experience, while others have been reported by other users.

1. Camera issues
Occasionally, there are instances where the camera produces blotchy or distorted images. This seems to be a software optimization problem, as the issue only appears when viewing the photos in the gallery, not during the actual capture.

2. Display color problems
The display has a slightly greenish tint, which was a known issue with the previous model. This has been resolved in the new version, but now there are instances of reddish discoloration. To check for this, simply set the screen brightness to the lowest level and view a black screen - the edges may appear reddish, and in some cases, there may even be a visible separation between the display layers.

3. Camera lens fogging
Camera lens fogging is not uncommon, even with traditional manufacturing processes. While it's only a problem for a small number of devices, it's still something to be aware of.

4. Gaps and spacing
Some users have reported that the device has noticeable gaps, to the point where you can insert a sheet of paper. This seems to be a common issue across many smartphone models.

5. Mute button issues
The mute button sometimes fails to respond, leaving the device in a non-silent mode, which can be quite inconvenient.

6. Signal quality
While the new model uses a more advanced modem, the signal performance doesn't seem to be significantly better than the previous generation. In some cases, it may even be slightly worse.

Overall, these issues appear to be mostly software-related, and the manufacturer has acknowledged a couple of the problems.

"I've been experiencing an issue with my new device where it seems to freeze up after transferring data from my old phone. According to an internal memo, the company is aware of this problem and is investigating it. As a temporary workaround, they've advised users to force restart the device if it becomes unresponsive for more than 5 minutes.

I also read that there was a similar issue with device activation earlier this week, but the company released a software update to try and address those setup and migration problems. Hopefully that will help resolve the freezing issue as well.

"Recently, some bloggers have tested the performance of various USB-A chargers with the latest smartphone model. The results show that while Huawei's 66W and 88W chargers are unable to charge the device, chargers from brands like Xiaomi and OPPO work fine. This topic has generated a lot of discussion. In response, the company's customer service has stated that the incompatibility may be related to certain charging protocols. Regarding the compatibility of the latest smartphone model with USB-A ports, the customer service has mentioned that using shared power banks or Type-C cables may potentially damage the battery. The fast charging process for this model is divided into two stages - fast charging (0-80%) and trickle charging (80-100%), and charging performance may vary across different device models. Additionally, some brand stores have cautioned customers against using Android-compatible Type-C cables to charge this model, as the port spacing is relatively small and may cause damage. However, some users believe this warning could be motivated by the company's own interests, as their official cables are priced higher, potentially leading to increased profits.","Third-party charger, data cable incompatibility"
