"After upgrading to the latest version of the operating system, many users have reported issues with their mobile devices not detecting the SIM card. According to some online reports, the phone may display a ""No SIM card"" message, and even switching to airplane mode may not resolve the problem. Fortunately, a simple restart of the device seems to fix the issue for most users.

However, this problem is not limited to the latest OS update - some owners of the newest smartphone model have also encountered the ""No SIM card"" problem, with the issue persisting even after a restart. Industry experts suggest that this could be related to compatibility issues between the phone's baseband and the carrier's network in certain regions, which may prevent the device from properly recognizing the local network.

In the past, a similar problem was also reported after a previous OS update, where some users experienced ""no service"" errors due to coverage signal issues. In those cases, a restart or removing and re-inserting the SIM card helped resolve the problem for some, while others had to visit a carrier store to get a new SIM card.

Overall, it appears that software updates can sometimes introduce compatibility problems between mobile devices and carrier networks, leading to SIM card detection issues. Hopefully the manufacturer can address this problem through future software patches.",sim card not detected,s_68,"Users report SIM card detection issues after OS update, possibly due to compatibility problems.","The comment describes issues with the device not detecting the SIM card after an operating system update, which is consistent with the 'SIM card not detected' category.",sim card not detected
