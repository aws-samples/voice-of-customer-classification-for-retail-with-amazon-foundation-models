    "### Using RAG technique to enhance the solution by retrieving and injecting few shot examples into the prompt\n",
    "### What is RAG?\n",
    "RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM (Large Language Model) knowledge with additional data.\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model's cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical RAG application has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. This usually happens offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Few-Shot Learning?\n",
    "Few-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm that enables models to generalize from a limited number of labeled examples. Unlike traditional supervised learning, which requires large datasets for training, few-shot learning allows models to adapt to new tasks or classes with minimal data. This is akin to how humans can learn new concepts quickly from just a few instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using RAG and Few-Shot Learning to Classify VoC\n",
    "With the introduction of RAG and Few-Shot Learning, we can now apply these concepts practically. In this lab, we will utilize the RAG technique together with Few-Shot Learning to classify Voice of Customer data. This session will build upon the skills developed in the last two labs, as we will continue to employ prompt engineering and embedding techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Your objectives are:\n",
    "- Setup a vector database using [Chroma integration in LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/chroma/) \n",
    "- Use Amazon Titan embedding model to embed the labeled examples and store into the vector database\n",
    "- Build a RAG chain that retrieves top k most relevant examples from vector store and generate the classification result"

      "I've been using the new smartphone model for a while now, and while it has some great features, I've also encountered a few issues. Some of these problems are from my own experience, while others have been reported by other users.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Camera issues\n",
      "Occasionally, there are instances where the camera produces blotchy or distorted images. This seems to be a software optimization problem, as the issue only appears when viewing the photos in the gallery, not during the actual capture.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Display color problems\n",
      "The display has a slightly greenish tint, which was a known issue with the previous model. This has been resolved in the new version, but now there are instances of reddish discoloration. To check for this, simply set the screen brightness to the lowest level and view a black screen - the edges may appear reddish, and in some cases, there may even be a visible separation between the display layers.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Camera lens fogging\n",
      "Camera lens fogging is not uncommon, even with traditional manufacturing processes. While it's only a problem for a small number of devices, it's still something to be aware of.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Gaps and spacing\n",
      "Some users have reported that the device has noticeable gaps, to the point where you can insert a sheet of paper. This seems to be a common issue across many smartphone models.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Mute button issues\n",
      "The mute button sometimes fails to respond, leaving the device in a non-silent mode, which can be quite inconvenient.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Signal quality\n",
      "While the new model uses a more advanced modem, the signal performance doesn't seem to be significantly better than the previous generation. In some cases, it may even be slightly worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these issues appear to be mostly software-related, and the manufacturer has acknowledged a couple of the problems.
