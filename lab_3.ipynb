    "### Using RAG technique to enhance the solution by retrieving and injecting few shot examples into the prompt\n",
    "### What is RAG?\n",
    "RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data.\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model's cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical RAG application has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. This usually happens offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Few-Shot Learning?\n",
    "Few-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm that enables models to generalize from a limited number of labeled examples. Unlike traditional supervised learning, which requires large datasets for training, few-shot learning allows models to adapt to new tasks or classes with minimal data. This is akin to how humans can learn new concepts quickly from just a few instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using RAG and Few-Shot Learning to Classify VoC\n",
    "With the introduction of RAG and Few-Shot Learning, we can now apply these concepts practically. In this lab, we will utilize the RAG technique together with Few-Shot Learning to classify Voice of Customer data. This session will build upon the skills developed in the last two labs, as we will continue to employ prompt engineering and embedding techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Your objectives are:\n",
    "- Setup a vector database using [Chroma integration in LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/chroma/) \n",
    "- Use Amazon Titan embedding model to embed the labeled examples and store into the vector database\n",
    "- Build a RAG chain that retrieves top k most relevant examples from vector store and generate the classification result"

Some of these problems are from my own experience, while others have been reported by other users.\\n\\n1. Camera issues\\nOccasionally, there are instances where the camera produces blotchy or distorted images. This seems to be a software optimization problem, as the issue only appears when viewing the photos in the gallery, not during the actual capture.\\n\\n2. Display color problems\\nThe display has a slightly greenish tint, which was a known issue with the previous model. This has been resolved in the new version, but now there are instances of reddish discoloration. To check for this, simply set the screen brightness to the lowest level and view a black screen - the edges may appear reddish, and in some cases, there may even be a visible separation between the display layers.\\n\\n3. Camera lens fogging\\nCamera lens fogging is not uncommon, even with traditional manufacturing processes. While it's only a problem for a small number of devices, it's still something to be aware of.\\n\\n4. Gaps and spacing\\nSome users have reported that the device has noticeable gaps, to the point where you can insert a sheet of paper. This seems to be a common issue across many smartphone models.\\n\\n5. Mute button issues\\nThe mute button sometimes fails to respond, leaving the device in a non-silent mode, which can be quite inconvenient.\\n\\n6. Signal quality\\nWhile the new model uses a more advanced modem, the signal performance doesn't seem to be significantly better than the previous generation. In some cases, it may even be slightly worse.\\n\\nOverall, these issues appear to be mostly software-related, and the manufacturer has acknowledged a couple of the problems. Users don't need to panic, as future software updates should address these concerns.

Guo expects the company to address this problem through software updates, but the improvements may be limited unless they are willing to reduce the processor performance. If the company fails to properly resolve this issue, it could negatively impact the sales volume of this product line.

      "{'comment': 'According to the analysis by analyst Guo Minghao, the overheating issue with the current smartphone model is not related to the 3nm process used by the chip manufacturer. Instead, it is likely due to design compromises made to reduce the weight of the device, such as a smaller heat dissipation area and the use of titanium alloy which may impact the cooling performance. Guo expects the company to address this problem through software updates, but the improvements may be limited unless they are willing to reduce the processor performance. If the company fails to properly resolve this issue, it could negatively impact the sales volume of this product line. Additionally, the use of titanium alloy for the first time in the new smartphone models has resulted in a series of problems, including easily scratched surfaces, discoloration of the metal frame, and poor drop resistance - all of which need to be addressed in future product iterations.', 'category': 'Overheating'}\n",

      "{'comment': 'Recently, some of the first owners of the new smartphone models have complained online that the phones overheat when in use or charging. The new smartphone series has been jokingly referred to as \"fiery fruit\" as a result.\\n\\nAccording to reports, the company has acknowledged that there are some issues that may be causing the phones to run at high temperatures, including bugs in the latest operating system. The company stated that it will fix these problems in an upcoming software update. They also noted that the overheating issue does not pose a safety risk and will not impact the long-term performance of the devices.\\n\\nAdditionally, the company said the overheating has also been observed when running certain third-party apps, and they are working with the app developers to address these problems.\\n\\nBased on user reports, the phones can get quite hot during normal use. For example, one user recorded the phone\\'s temperature reaching 49°C (120°F) after just 30 minutes of gaming in a 26.5°C (80°F) room environment, with noticeable frame rate drops. Another user reported the phone reaching 51°C (124°F) after 10 minutes of video recording.\\n\\nThis issue has generated a lot of discussion and concern among users online.', 'category': 'Overheating'}\n",
      "{'comment': 'The latest flagship device, the new generation smartphone, has been facing some issues. Reportedly, some early adopters have complained that the phone overheats during use or while charging. The device has been jokingly referred to as the \"dragon fruit\" due to this issue. \\n\\nIn a video, a content creator tested the phone by playing a game in a 26.5°C (79.7°F) room environment. After 30 minutes of gameplay, the device\\'s temperature had risen to 49°C (120.2°F) and experienced visible frame rate drops.', 'category': 'Overheating'}\n",
      "{'comment': 'According to the analysis by analyst Guo Minghao, the overheating issue with the current smartphone model is not related to the 3nm process used by the chip manufacturer. Instead, it is likely due to design compromises made to reduce the weight of the device, such as a smaller heat dissipation area and the use of titanium alloy which may impact the cooling performance. Guo expects the company to address this problem through software updates, but the improvements may be limited unless they are willing to reduce the processor performance. If the company fails to properly resolve this issue, it could negatively impact the sales volume of this product line. Additionally, the use of titanium alloy for the first time in the new smartphone models has resulted in a series of problems, including easily scratched surfaces, discoloration of the metal frame, and poor drop resistance - all of which need to be addressed in future product iterations.', 'category': 'Overheating'}\n",
      "{'comment': \"I've been using the new smartphone model for a while now, and while it has some great features, I've also encountered a few issues. Some of these problems are from my own experience, while others have been reported by other users.\\n\\n1. Camera issues\\nOccasionally, there are instances where the camera produces blotchy or distorted images. This seems to be a software optimization problem, as the issue only appears when viewing the photos in the gallery, not during the actual capture.\\n\\n2. Display color problems\\nThe display has a slightly greenish tint, which was a known issue with the previous model. This has been resolved in the new version, but now there are instances of reddish discoloration. To check for this, simply set the screen brightness to the lowest level and view a black screen - the edges may appear reddish, and in some cases, there may even be a visible separation between the display layers.\\n\\n3. Camera lens fogging\\nCamera lens fogging is not uncommon, even with traditional manufacturing processes. While it's only a problem for a small number of devices, it's still something to be aware of.\\n\\n4. Gaps and spacing\\nSome users have reported that the device has noticeable gaps, to the point where you can insert a sheet of paper. This seems to be a common issue across many smartphone models.\\n\\n5. Mute button issues\\nThe mute button sometimes fails to respond, leaving the device in a non-silent mode, which can be quite inconvenient.\\n\\n6. Signal quality\\nWhile the new model uses a more advanced modem, the signal performance doesn't seem to be significantly better than the previous generation. In some cases, it may even be slightly worse.\\n\\nOverall, these issues appear to be mostly software-related, and the manufacturer has acknowledged a couple of the problems. Users don't need to panic, as future software updates should address these concerns. For those who haven't purchased the device yet, it might be worth waiting a bit, as the prices are likely to come down over time.\", 'category': 'Camera color deviation'}\n",

Reportedly, some early adopters have complained that the phone overheats during use or while charging.

      "{'comment': 'According to the analysis by analyst Guo Minghao, the overheating issue with the current smartphone model is not related to the 3nm process used by the chip manufacturer. Instead, it is likely due to design compromises made to reduce the weight of the device, such as a smaller heat dissipation area and the use of titanium alloy which may impact the cooling performance. Guo expects the company to address this problem through software updates, but the improvements may be limited unless they are willing to reduce the processor performance. If the company fails to properly resolve this issue, it could negatively impact the sales volume of this product line. Additionally, the use of titanium alloy for the first time in the new smartphone models has resulted in a series of problems, including easily scratched surfaces, discoloration of the metal frame, and poor drop resistance - all of which need to be addressed in future product iterations.', 'category': 'Overheating'}\n",

The results show that while Huawei's 66W and 88W chargers are unable to charge the device, chargers from brands like Xiaomi and OPPO work fine. This topic has generated a lot of discussion. In response, the company's customer service has stated that the incompatibility may be related to certain charging protocols. Regarding the compatibility of the latest smartphone model with USB-A ports, the customer service has mentioned that using shared power banks or Type-C cables may potentially damage the battery. The fast charging process for this model is divided into two stages - fast charging (0-80%) and trickle charging (80-100%), and charging performance may vary across different device models. Additionally, some brand stores have cautioned customers against using Android-compatible Type-C cables to charge this model, as the port spacing is relatively small and may cause damage.

Some of these problems are from my own experience, while others have been reported by other users.\\n\\n1. Camera issues\\nOccasionally, there are instances where the camera produces blotchy or distorted images. This seems to be a software optimization problem, as the issue only appears when viewing the photos in the gallery, not during the actual capture.\\n\\n2. Display color problems\\nThe display has a slightly greenish tint, which was a known issue with the previous model. This has been resolved in the new version, but now there are instances of reddish discoloration. To check for this, simply set the screen brightness to the lowest level and view a black screen - the edges may appear reddish, and in some cases, there may even be a visible separation between the display layers.\\n\\n3. Camera lens fogging\\nCamera lens fogging is not uncommon, even with traditional manufacturing processes. While it's only a problem for a small number of devices, it's still something to be aware of.\\n\\n4. Gaps and spacing\\nSome users have reported that the device has noticeable gaps, to the point where you can insert a sheet of paper. This seems to be a common issue across many smartphone models.\\n\\n5. Mute button issues\\nThe mute button sometimes fails to respond, leaving the device in a non-silent mode, which can be quite inconvenient.\\n\\n6. Signal quality\\nWhile the new model uses a more advanced modem, the signal performance doesn't seem to be significantly better than the previous generation. In some cases, it may even be slightly worse.\\n\\nOverall, these issues appear to be mostly software-related, and the manufacturer has acknowledged a couple of the problems.

      "{'comment': \"I've been using the new smartphone model for a while now, and while it has some great features, I've also encountered a few issues. Some of these problems are from my own experience, while others have been reported by other users.\\n\\n1. Camera issues\\nOccasionally, there are instances where the camera produces blotchy or distorted images. This seems to be a software optimization problem, as the issue only appears when viewing the photos in the gallery, not during the actual capture.\\n\\n2. Display color problems\\nThe display has a slightly greenish tint, which was a known issue with the previous model. This has been resolved in the new version, but now there are instances of reddish discoloration. To check for this, simply set the screen brightness to the lowest level and view a black screen - the edges may appear reddish, and in some cases, there may even be a visible separation between the display layers.\\n\\n3. Camera lens fogging\\nCamera lens fogging is not uncommon, even with traditional manufacturing processes. While it's only a problem for a small number of devices, it's still something to be aware of.\\n\\n4. Gaps and spacing\\nSome users have reported that the device has noticeable gaps, to the point where you can insert a sheet of paper. This seems to be a common issue across many smartphone models.\\n\\n5. Mute button issues\\nThe mute button sometimes fails to respond, leaving the device in a non-silent mode, which can be quite inconvenient.\\n\\n6. Signal quality\\nWhile the new model uses a more advanced modem, the signal performance doesn't seem to be significantly better than the previous generation. In some cases, it may even be slightly worse.\\n\\nOverall, these issues appear to be mostly software-related, and the manufacturer has acknowledged a couple of the problems. Users don't need to panic, as future software updates should address these concerns. For those who haven't purchased the device yet, it might be worth waiting a bit, as the prices are likely to come down over time.\", 'category': 'Camera color deviation'}\n",

The fast charging process for this model is divided into two stages - fast charging (0-80%) and trickle charging (80-100%), and charging performance may vary across different device models. Additionally, some brand stores have cautioned customers against using Android-compatible Type-C cables to charge this model, as the port spacing is relatively small and may cause damage.

Instead, it is likely due to design compromises made to reduce the weight of the device, such as a smaller heat dissipation area and the use of titanium alloy which may impact the cooling performance. Guo expects the company to address this problem through software updates, but the improvements may be limited unless they are willing to reduce the processor performance. If the company fails to properly resolve this issue, it could negatively impact the sales volume of this product line. Additionally, the use of titanium alloy for the first time in the new smartphone models has resulted in a series of problems, including easily scratched surfaces, discoloration of the metal frame, and poor drop resistance - all of which need to be addressed in future product iterations.', 'category': 'Overheating'}\n",

Some of these problems are from my own experience, while others have been reported by other users.\\n\\n1. Camera issues\\nOccasionally, there are instances where the camera produces blotchy or distorted images. This seems to be a software optimization problem, as the issue only appears when viewing the photos in the gallery, not during the actual capture.\\n\\n2. Display color problems\\nThe display has a slightly greenish tint, which was a known issue with the previous model. This has been resolved in the new version, but now there are instances of reddish discoloration. To check for this, simply set the screen brightness to the lowest level and view a black screen - the edges may appear reddish, and in some cases, there may even be a visible separation between the display layers.\\n\\n3. Camera lens fogging\\nCamera lens fogging is not uncommon, even with traditional manufacturing processes. While it's only a problem for a small number of devices, it's still something to be aware of.\\n\\n4. Gaps and spacing\\nSome users have reported that the device has noticeable gaps, to the point where you can insert a sheet of paper. This seems to be a common issue across many smartphone models.\\n\\n5. Mute button issues\\nThe mute button sometimes fails to respond, leaving the device in a non-silent mode, which can be quite inconvenient.\\n\\n6. Signal quality\\nWhile the new model uses a more advanced modem, the signal performance doesn't seem to be significantly better than the previous generation. In some cases, it may even be slightly worse.\\n\\nOverall, these issues appear to be mostly software-related, and the manufacturer has acknowledged a couple of the problems. Users don't need to panic, as future software updates should address these concerns.

      "{'comment': \"I've been using the new smartphone model for a while now, and while it has some great features, I've also encountered a few issues. Some of these problems are from my own experience, while others have been reported by other users.\\n\\n1. Camera issues\\nOccasionally, there are instances where the camera produces blotchy or distorted images. This seems to be a software optimization problem, as the issue only appears when viewing the photos in the gallery, not during the actual capture.\\n\\n2. Display color problems\\nThe display has a slightly greenish tint, which was a known issue with the previous model. This has been resolved in the new version, but now there are instances of reddish discoloration. To check for this, simply set the screen brightness to the lowest level and view a black screen - the edges may appear reddish, and in some cases, there may even be a visible separation between the display layers.\\n\\n3. Camera lens fogging\\nCamera lens fogging is not uncommon, even with traditional manufacturing processes. While it's only a problem for a small number of devices, it's still something to be aware of.\\n\\n4. Gaps and spacing\\nSome users have reported that the device has noticeable gaps, to the point where you can insert a sheet of paper. This seems to be a common issue across many smartphone models.\\n\\n5. Mute button issues\\nThe mute button sometimes fails to respond, leaving the device in a non-silent mode, which can be quite inconvenient.\\n\\n6. Signal quality\\nWhile the new model uses a more advanced modem, the signal performance doesn't seem to be significantly better than the previous generation. In some cases, it may even be slightly worse.\\n\\nOverall, these issues appear to be mostly software-related, and the manufacturer has acknowledged a couple of the problems. Users don't need to panic, as future software updates should address these concerns. For those who haven't purchased the device yet, it might be worth waiting a bit, as the prices are likely to come down over time.\", 'category': 'Camera color deviation'}\n",

The results show that while Huawei's 66W and 88W chargers are unable to charge the device, chargers from brands like Xiaomi and OPPO work fine. This topic has generated a lot of discussion. In response, the company's customer service has stated that the incompatibility may be related to certain charging protocols. Regarding the compatibility of the latest smartphone model with USB-A ports, the customer service has mentioned that using shared power banks or Type-C cables may potentially damage the battery. The fast charging process for this model is divided into two stages - fast charging (0-80%) and trickle charging (80-100%), and charging performance may vary across different device models. Additionally, some brand stores have cautioned customers against using Android-compatible Type-C cables to charge this model, as the port spacing is relatively small and may cause damage. However, some users believe this warning could be motivated by the company's own interests, as their official cables are priced higher, potentially leading to increased profits.\", 'category': 'Third-party charger, data cable incompatibility'}\n",

When I set the brightness to the maximum, it's significantly higher than my friend's same model. This seems a bit strange.\\n3. The screen appears yellowish when viewed straight on, but turns cooler when viewed from an angle. In fact, I actually prefer the cooler color tone from the side view (though it's a bit uncomfortable). I've asked the store and the manufacturer, and they said this is a characteristic of OLED screens.

      "{'comment': \"I've been using the new smartphone model for a while now, and while it has some great features, I've also encountered a few issues. Some of these problems are from my own experience, while others have been reported by other users.\\n\\n1. Camera issues\\nOccasionally, there are instances where the camera produces blotchy or distorted images. This seems to be a software optimization problem, as the issue only appears when viewing the photos in the gallery, not during the actual capture.\\n\\n2. Display color problems\\nThe display has a slightly greenish tint, which was a known issue with the previous model. This has been resolved in the new version, but now there are instances of reddish discoloration. To check for this, simply set the screen brightness to the lowest level and view a black screen - the edges may appear reddish, and in some cases, there may even be a visible separation between the display layers.\\n\\n3. Camera lens fogging\\nCamera lens fogging is not uncommon, even with traditional manufacturing processes. While it's only a problem for a small number of devices, it's still something to be aware of.\\n\\n4. Gaps and spacing\\nSome users have reported that the device has noticeable gaps, to the point where you can insert a sheet of paper. This seems to be a common issue across many smartphone models.\\n\\n5. Mute button issues\\nThe mute button sometimes fails to respond, leaving the device in a non-silent mode, which can be quite inconvenient.\\n\\n6. Signal quality\\nWhile the new model uses a more advanced modem, the signal performance doesn't seem to be significantly better than the previous generation. In some cases, it may even be slightly worse.\\n\\nOverall, these issues appear to be mostly software-related, and the manufacturer has acknowledged a couple of the problems. Users don't need to panic, as future software updates should address these concerns. For those who haven't purchased the device yet, it might be worth waiting a bit, as the prices are likely to come down over time.\", 'category': 'Camera color deviation'}\n",

If the company fails to properly resolve this issue, it could negatively impact the sales volume of this product line.

      "{'comment': 'Recently, some of the first owners of the new smartphone models have complained online that the phones overheat when in use or charging. The new smartphone series has been jokingly referred to as \"fiery fruit\" as a result.\\n\\nAccording to reports, the company has acknowledged that there are some issues that may be causing the phones to run at high temperatures, including bugs in the latest operating system. The company stated that it will fix these problems in an upcoming software update. They also noted that the overheating issue does not pose a safety risk and will not impact the long-term performance of the devices.\\n\\nAdditionally, the company said the overheating has also been observed when running certain third-party apps, and they are working with the app developers to address these problems.\\n\\nBased on user reports, the phones can get quite hot during normal use. For example, one user recorded the phone\\'s temperature reaching 49°C (120°F) after just 30 minutes of gaming in a 26.5°C (80°F) room environment, with noticeable frame rate drops. Another user reported the phone reaching 51°C (124°F) after 10 minutes of video recording.\\n\\nThis issue has generated a lot of discussion and concern among users online.', 'category': 'Overheating'}\n",
      "{'comment': 'According to the analysis by analyst Guo Minghao, the overheating issue with the current smartphone model is not related to the 3nm process used by the chip manufacturer. Instead, it is likely due to design compromises made to reduce the weight of the device, such as a smaller heat dissipation area and the use of titanium alloy which may impact the cooling performance. Guo expects the company to address this problem through software updates, but the improvements may be limited unless they are willing to reduce the processor performance. If the company fails to properly resolve this issue, it could negatively impact the sales volume of this product line. Additionally, the use of titanium alloy for the first time in the new smartphone models has resulted in a series of problems, including easily scratched surfaces, discoloration of the metal frame, and poor drop resistance - all of which need to be addressed in future product iterations.', 'category': 'Overheating'}\n",

Some of these problems are from my own experience, while others have been reported by other users.\\n\\n1. Camera issues\\nOccasionally, there are instances where the camera produces blotchy or distorted images. This seems to be a software optimization problem, as the issue only appears when viewing the photos in the gallery, not during the actual capture.\\n\\n2. Display color problems\\nThe display has a slightly greenish tint, which was a known issue with the previous model. This has been resolved in the new version, but now there are instances of reddish discoloration. To check for this, simply set the screen brightness to the lowest level and view a black screen - the edges may appear reddish, and in some cases, there may even be a visible separation between the display layers.\\n\\n3. Camera lens fogging\\nCamera lens fogging is not uncommon, even with traditional manufacturing processes. While it's only a problem for a small number of devices, it's still something to be aware of.\\n\\n4. Gaps and spacing\\nSome users have reported that the device has noticeable gaps, to the point where you can insert a sheet of paper. This seems to be a common issue across many smartphone models.\\n\\n5. Mute button issues\\nThe mute button sometimes fails to respond, leaving the device in a non-silent mode, which can be quite inconvenient.\\n\\n6. Signal quality\\nWhile the new model uses a more advanced modem, the signal performance doesn't seem to be significantly better than the previous generation. In some cases, it may even be slightly worse.\\n\\nOverall, these issues appear to be mostly software-related, and the manufacturer has acknowledged a couple of the problems. Users don't need to panic, as future software updates should address these concerns.

      "{'comment': \"Recently, some bloggers have tested the performance of various USB-A chargers with the latest smartphone model. The results show that while Huawei's 66W and 88W chargers are unable to charge the device, chargers from brands like Xiaomi and OPPO work fine. This topic has generated a lot of discussion. In response, the company's customer service has stated that the incompatibility may be related to certain charging protocols. Regarding the compatibility of the latest smartphone model with USB-A ports, the customer service has mentioned that using shared power banks or Type-C cables may potentially damage the battery. The fast charging process for this model is divided into two stages - fast charging (0-80%) and trickle charging (80-100%), and charging performance may vary across different device models. Additionally, some brand stores have cautioned customers against using Android-compatible Type-C cables to charge this model, as the port spacing is relatively small and may cause damage. However, some users believe this warning could be motivated by the company's own interests, as their official cables are priced higher, potentially leading to increased profits.\", 'category': 'Third-party charger, data cable incompatibility'}\n",

The fast charging process for this model is divided into two stages - fast charging (0-80%) and trickle charging (80-100%), and charging performance may vary across different device models. Additionally, some brand stores have cautioned customers against using Android-compatible Type-C cables to charge this model, as the port spacing is relatively small and may cause damage.

Some of these problems are from my own experience, while others have been reported by other users.\\n\\n1. Camera issues\\nOccasionally, there are instances where the camera produces blotchy or distorted images. This seems to be a software optimization problem, as the issue only appears when viewing the photos in the gallery, not during the actual capture.\\n\\n2. Display color problems\\nThe display has a slightly greenish tint, which was a known issue with the previous model. This has been resolved in the new version, but now there are instances of reddish discoloration. To check for this, simply set the screen brightness to the lowest level and view a black screen - the edges may appear reddish, and in some cases, there may even be a visible separation between the display layers.\\n\\n3. Camera lens fogging\\nCamera lens fogging is not uncommon, even with traditional manufacturing processes. While it's only a problem for a small number of devices, it's still something to be aware of.\\n\\n4. Gaps and spacing\\nSome users have reported that the device has noticeable gaps, to the point where you can insert a sheet of paper.

Mute button issues\\nThe mute button sometimes fails to respond, leaving the device in a non-silent mode, which can be quite inconvenient.\\n\\n6. Signal quality\\nWhile the new model uses a more advanced modem, the signal performance doesn't seem to be significantly better than the previous generation. In some cases, it may even be slightly worse.\\n\\nOverall, these issues appear to be mostly software-related, and the manufacturer has acknowledged a couple of the problems.

Some of these problems are from my own experience, while others have been reported by other users.\\n\\n1. Camera issues\\nOccasionally, there are instances where the camera produces blotchy or distorted images. This seems to be a software optimization problem, as the issue only appears when viewing the photos in the gallery, not during the actual capture.\\n\\n2. Display color problems\\nThe display has a slightly greenish tint, which was a known issue with the previous model. This has been resolved in the new version, but now there are instances of reddish discoloration. To check for this, simply set the screen brightness to the lowest level and view a black screen - the edges may appear reddish, and in some cases, there may even be a visible separation between the display layers.\\n\\n3. Camera lens fogging\\nCamera lens fogging is not uncommon, even with traditional manufacturing processes. While it's only a problem for a small number of devices, it's still something to be aware of.\\n\\n4. Gaps and spacing\\nSome users have reported that the device has noticeable gaps, to the point where you can insert a sheet of paper. This seems to be a common issue across many smartphone models.\\n\\n5. Mute button issues\\nThe mute button sometimes fails to respond, leaving the device in a non-silent mode, which can be quite inconvenient.\\n\\n6. Signal quality\\nWhile the new model uses a more advanced modem, the signal performance doesn't seem to be significantly better than the previous generation. In some cases, it may even be slightly worse.\\n\\nOverall, these issues appear to be mostly software-related, and the manufacturer has acknowledged a couple of the problems. Users don't need to panic, as future software updates should address these concerns. For those who haven't purchased the device yet, it might be worth waiting a bit, as the prices are likely to come down over time.\", 'category': 'Camera color deviation'}\n",
      "{'comment': 'Since the release of the new smartphone series, many users have experienced various issues. One of the major problems is the camera lens shaking and making unusual noises when using third-party apps. Another issue is the constant pop-up windows when trying to copy text or images, which can be quite frustrating. \\n\\nSome users have also reported problems with data backups, where the process of transferring data to a new device gets interrupted. The file sharing feature also seems to be malfunctioning for some. Additionally, there have been reports of camera delays.\\n\\nAccording to media reports, the manufacturer has acknowledged these problems and plans to release a software update to fix them in the coming week.', 'category': 'Camera black screen'}\n",

This notification cannot be dismissed, even after freeing up a significant amount of storage. Some users have reported seeing this message despite having 40GB or more of free space.\\nThis issue seems to be widespread, with many users discussing it on social media platforms, but the company has yet to provide a response. Restarting the device does not appear to resolve the problem. While this notification may not directly impact daily usage, it can be misleading and force users to unnecessarily clear storage space or delete files.\\nAdditionally, some users have encountered other issues, such as the inability to access the app store or loss of cellular service, though these seem to be less prevalent. There have also been complaints about changes to the \"focus mode\" feature, which some users feel has lost an important functionality.\\nIt\\'s understandable that even the most advanced software can have bugs upon release, but users are primarily seeking a stable, smooth, and battery-efficient experience, rather than a constant stream of new features accompanied by issues.
