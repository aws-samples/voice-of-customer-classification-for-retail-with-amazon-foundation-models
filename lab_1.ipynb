This not only affects the user experience, but could also pose a challenge to the company's sales performance.\\n\\nOn Reddit, a user posted that their new smartphone's back reached 108°F (42°C) after just 5 minutes of use. Further testing showed the temperature even reaching 116.5°F (47°C), which is clearly outside the normal heating range for a mobile device.\\n\\nTech media has also reported on this overheating problem. A user survey with 6,696 participants found that 18.79% experienced overheating during charging, 11.22% in intensive usage like gaming, and 26.91% during regular daily use.\\n\\nInvestigations suggest this may not be related to the 3nm manufacturing process, but rather due to compromises in the thermal design, such as smaller heat dissipation areas and the use of titanium alloy. \\n\\nThe company has not yet publicly addressed this issue, but is expected to provide a software update as a fix. However, unless processor performance is reduced, the impact may be limited, as the root cause of the thermal challenges remains unresolved.\\n\\nIf this problem is not properly addressed, it could negatively impact the sales of these new smartphone models. Persistent overheating issues can severely undermine the user experience and satisfaction.\\n\\nOverall, this overheating problem poses a significant challenge for the company.
