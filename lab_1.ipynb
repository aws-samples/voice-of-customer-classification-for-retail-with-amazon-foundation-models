    "In the retail industry, understanding the Voice of the Customer (VOC) is crucial for gaining insights into customer preferences and pain points. By analyzing and categorizing customer feedback, retailers can improve their products, services, and overall customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on workshop guides participants through the process of classifying Voice of Customer (VOC) data using Amazon Titan on Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "You will be provided with sample data and will be tasked with classifying customer feedback into categories and generating a summary analysis report.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, you will learn how to use Prompt Engineering to classify customer feedback.\n",
    "- Then, you will explore the concept of embedding techniques and use them to classify customer feedback by semantic comparison.\n",
    "- After that, you will be provided with additional example data. You will explore the concept of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and use it to enhance the classification process by dynamically retrieving relevant few-shot examples.\n",
    "- At the end of the workshop, you will be able to generate a comprehensive analysis report that provides insights into the VOC data and helps retailers improve their products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A task of developing a VoC Classifier has been assigned to you:\n",
    "You will be provided with a sample dataset in \"data/comments.csv\", each record represents a customer comment and its corresponding groundtruth category. You need to write prompt to perform the classification task using the Amazon Titan Model, and then compare the prediction result with the groundtruth and calculate the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your objectives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classify each customer feedback comment into 35+ categories\n",
    "- Provide the reasoning behind each classification\n",
    "- Summarize each customer comment in a brief description\n",

This not only affects the user experience, but could also pose a challenge to the company's sales performance.\\n\\nOn Reddit, a user posted that their new smartphone's back reached 108°F (42°C) after just 5 minutes of use. Further testing showed the temperature even reaching 116.5°F (47°C), which is clearly outside the normal heating range for a mobile device.\\n\\nTech media has also reported on this overheating problem. A user survey with 6,696 participants found that 18.79% experienced overheating during charging, 11.22% in intensive usage like gaming, and 26.91% during regular daily use.\\n\\nInvestigations suggest this may not be related to the 3nm manufacturing process, but rather due to compromises in the thermal design, such as smaller heat dissipation areas and the use of titanium alloy. \\n\\nThe company has not yet publicly addressed this issue, but is expected to provide a software update as a fix. However, unless processor performance is reduced, the impact may be limited, as the root cause of the thermal challenges remains unresolved.\\n\\nIf this problem is not properly addressed, it could negatively impact the sales of these new smartphone models. Persistent overheating issues can severely undermine the user experience and satisfaction.\\n\\nOverall, this overheating problem poses a significant challenge for the company.
